## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think that you have found a security issue in Timeular API, please do not use the issue tracker and do not post it publicly. Instead, all security issues must be submitted using `Report a vulnerability` that can be found [on Security tab](https://github.com/Raptek/timeular-api/security).
