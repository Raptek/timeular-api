## Motivation

As a Developer\
To get paid for my work\
I have to report my time spent on work

When working on multiple projects, depending on habits, sometimes it's hard to track time spent on given task when context switching occurs frequently. Filling work time in Jira after each task doesn't work for me. Doing this every day isn't for me either. Trying to remember what I had worked on two weeks earlier was tedious. I like gadgets. My colleague showed my his dice. Each side assigned to different project. I immediately felt in love with it. Now, my own dice sits in front of me, and when I see that it's in standby when I'm working, I know that it needs to be flipped on correct side.

Timeular application is great, but it lacks few features which would improve my workflow greatly. I wanted to create small app fulfilling all my requirements, but it was impossible to find time for it. And here comes [100 commitów](https://100commitow.pl/) - commit to making small changes for 100 days in a row. I didn't find any PHP library to use Timeular API, so I created one.
